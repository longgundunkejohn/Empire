- **Missing**: Settlement abilities

### 3. Game State Management

#### Real-time Synchronization
- **Partial**: Basic SignalR setup exists
- **Missing**: Game state broadcasting
- **Missing**: Action validation and synchronization
- **Missing**: Conflict resolution

#### Game Rules Enforcement
- **Missing**: Mulligan system
- **Missing**: Draw mechanics (4 Army + 3 Civic starting hand)
- **Missing**: Once-per-round action tracking
- **Missing**: Morale tracking (starting at 25)

### 4. Advanced Features

#### Card Effects System
- **Missing**: Dynamic card ability execution
- **Missing**: Triggered effects (e.g., "when this enters play")
- **Missing**: Conditional effects
- **Missing**: Effect timing and stack resolution

#### AI/Bot Players
- **Missing**: Computer opponents for single-player
- **Missing**: Difficulty levels
- **Missing**: AI decision-making algorithms

## Technical Issues Fixed During Analysis üîß

1. **Authentication Service Registration**: Fixed improper service registration in Program.cs
2. **API Base URL**: Corrected development API endpoint configuration
3. **CSS Keyframes**: Fixed CSS syntax error in DeckBuilder component
4. **Async Deadlock**: Removed `.Result` calls that could cause deadlocks
5. **Token Validation**: Added proper authorization to validate-token endpoint

## Implementation Priority Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

### Phase 1: Core Game Engine (High Priority)
1. **Initiative System**
   - Implement turn tracking
   - Add initiative passing logic
   - Create action validation framework

2. **Phase Management**
   - Implement automatic phase transitions
   - Add phase-specific UI states
   - Create phase change notifications

3. **Basic Card Deployment**
   - Implement mana system
   - Add tier checking
   - Create card deployment validation

### Phase 2: Combat and Movement (Medium Priority)
1. **Unit Positioning**
   - Implement Heartland/Territory movement
   - Add commit action mechanics
   - Create position state tracking

2. **Combat Resolution**
   - Implement damage calculation
   - Add simultaneous combat
   - Create unit death handling

### Phase 3: Advanced Mechanics (Lower Priority)
1. **Card Effects System**
   - Create effect execution framework
   - Implement triggered abilities
   - Add effect timing system

2. **Specialized Card Types**
   - Implement Chronicle mechanics
   - Add Settlement abilities
   - Create Tactic resolution

### Phase 4: Polish and Features (Future)
1. **AI Players**
2. **Spectator Mode**
3. **Replay System**
4. **Tournament Features**

## Database Schema Completeness

### Current Tables ‚úÖ
- Users
- UserDecks
- Cards (via JSON loading)

### Missing Tables ‚ùå
- GameSessions
- GameMoves/Actions
- PlayerGameStates
- ActiveEffects

## Card Data Analysis

### Current Card Database
- **Format**: JSON file with card definitions
- **Fields**: ID, Name, Type, Cost, Attack, Defense, Tier, Faction
- **Status**: Basic card data present

### Missing Card Data
- **Abilities**: Card-specific effects and abilities
- **Triggered Effects**: When/if conditions
- **Flavor Text**: Lore and description text
- **Balancing Data**: Win rates, usage statistics

## Estimated Development Time

### Minimum Viable Game (Core mechanics only)
- **Time**: 2-3 weeks full-time development
- **Features**: Basic gameplay, no advanced effects

### Full Featured Game
- **Time**: 2-3 months full-time development
- **Features**: All card effects, AI, polish

### Current Completion Percentage
- **Infrastructure**: 80% complete
- **UI/UX**: 70% complete
- **Game Logic**: 20% complete
- **Overall**: ~50% complete

## Next Steps Recommendation

1. **Start with Phase 1**: Focus on getting basic gameplay working
2. **Test Early**: Implement simple card interactions first
3. **Iterate**: Build core loop before adding complex features
4. **Playtesting**: Get feedback on game balance and mechanics

The foundation is solid, but the core game logic engine needs to be built to make this a playable TCG.
