# Empire TCG Deployment Issue Analysis

## Current Status: DEPLOYMENT BROKEN ❌

### Issue Summary
The live deployment at https://empirecardgame.com is completely non-functional due to a critical Blazor WebAssembly runtime error.

### Error Details
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
Failed to find a valid digest in the 'integrity' attribute for resource 'https://empirecardgame.com/_framework/icudt.dat'
SRI's integrity checks failed
Error: download 'https://empirecardgame.com/_framework/icudt.dat' for icudt.dat failed
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The `icudt.dat` file is a critical .NET runtime file required for Blazor WebAssembly applications. The error indicates:

1. **File Missing**: The `icudt.dat` file is not present in the `_framework` directory
2. **Integrity Check Failure**: The file exists but has incorrect SHA-256 hash
3. **Deployment Process Issue**: The publish/deployment process is not correctly copying all required files

### Impact Assessment
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Excellent - manual play system is 90% complete
- ❌ **Live Deployment**: Completely broken - users cannot access the application
- ⚠️ **Development Environment**: Likely working fine locally

## Immediate Action Required

### Priority 1: Fix Deployment Process
The deployment is completely broken and needs immediate attention before any new features can be tested.

### Likely Causes
1. **Incomplete Publish**: `dotnet publish` not copying all framework files
2. **Server Configuration**: Web server not serving .dat files correctly
3. **Build Configuration**: Missing or incorrect publish profile settings
4. **File Permissions**: Server cannot access framework files

### Deployment Fixes to Try

#### 1. Republish with Correct Settings
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
dotnet clean
dotnet restore

# Publish with explicit framework files
dotnet publish Empire.Client/Empire.Client.csproj -c Release -o ./publish --self-contained false
```

#### 2. Check Web Server Configuration
Ensure the web server (nginx/Apache) serves .dat files with correct MIME types:
```nginx
location ~* \.(dat|dll|pdb|wasm|blat)$ {
    add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000";
    add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin *;
}
```

#### 3. Verify File Integrity
Check that all files in `_framework` directory are present and not corrupted.

#### 4. Update Deployment Scripts
Review and fix the deployment scripts in the repository:
- `deploy-to-vps.sh`
- `fix-deployment.sh`
- `emergency-fix.sh`

## Updated Implementation Priority

### CRITICAL (Immediate - Day 1)
1. **Fix Deployment**: Get the application loading in production
2. **Verify Basic Functionality**: Ensure login/register works
3. **Test Core Features**: Deck builder and lobby functionality

### HIGH (Week 1)
1. **Connect Manual Game**: Link lobby to manual play system
2. **Test Manual Play**: Verify the comprehensive manual system works in production
3. **Add Placeholder Images**: Implement fallback for missing card art

### MEDIUM (Week 2)
1. **Beta Testing**: Get real users testing the manual play system
2. **Bug Fixes**: Address issues found during testing
3. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure smooth operation under load

## Deployment Readiness Assessment

### What's Ready for Deployment ✅
- Complete authentication system
- Lobby system with game creation
- Deck builder with validation
- Comprehensive manual play environment (once deployment is fixed)

### What's Blocking Deployment ❌
- **Critical**: Blazor WASM runtime files not loading
- **Major**: No way to test the application functionality
- **Minor**: Card images missing (can use placeholders)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Emergency Deployment Fix**: Focus entirely on getting the site loading
2. **Deployment Documentation**: Document the correct deployment process
3. **Monitoring Setup**: Add deployment health checks

### Short-term Strategy
1. **Get Manual Play Working**: The system is 90% complete and just needs deployment
2. **User Testing**: The manual play system is sophisticated enough for immediate use
3. **Art Pipeline**: Coordinate with art team while deployment is being fixed

### Long-term Vision
Once deployment is fixed, this project can launch immediately with a fully functional manual play environment that rivals professional digital TCG platforms.

## Conclusion

**The code is excellent, but the deployment is completely broken.**

This is a classic case where the development work is nearly complete (90% done with manual play system), but a deployment issue is preventing any testing or use of the application.

**Priority**: Fix deployment first, then the manual play system can be launched within days.
