- Territory control mechanics
- Resource/mana system implementation

#### 3. Client-Side Game Interface
**Current State**:
- Basic game board component exists
- Card components are implemented
- Hand and deck components exist

**Missing**:
- Interactive card playing
- Drag and drop functionality
- Game state visualization
- Player feedback and animations
- Territory interaction

#### 4. Authentication & User Management
**Current State**:
- Basic user system exists
- Deck saving/loading works

**Missing**:

#### Components
- **EmpireGameBoard**: Game board visualization (basic)
- **CardComponent**: Card display (functional)
- **HandComponent**: Hand management (basic)
- **TerritoryComponent**: Territory display (basic)

#### Services
- **GameHubService**: SignalR client (incomplete)
- **EmpireGameService**: Game logic client-side (basic)
- **CardDataService**: Card data management (functional)
- **DeckService**: Deck management (functional)

## What Cannot Be Determined from Code

### 1. Game Rules Implementation
- **Card Effects**: While the framework exists, specific card effects aren't implemented
- **Combat System**: No clear combat resolution logic
- **Victory Conditions**: Win/loss conditions not defined
- **Resource System**: Mana/resource generation and spending unclear

### 2. UI/UX Design
- **Visual Design**: No clear design system or styling guidelines
- **User Experience Flow**: Game flow and user interactions not fully defined
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile/tablet compatibility unclear

### 3. Performance & Scalability
- **Concurrent Games**: How many simultaneous games can be supported
- **Database Performance**: Query optimization and indexing strategy
- **Real-time Performance**: SignalR message frequency and optimization

### 4. Card Data Source
- **Card Database**: Where card data comes from (JSON file exists but source unclear)
- **Card Images**: Image management and storage strategy
- **Card Updates**: How new cards are added or existing cards modified

### 5. Deployment & Infrastructure
- **Production Environment**: Deployment strategy and infrastructure
- **SSL/Security**: Security implementation details
- **Monitoring**: Logging and monitoring strategy

## Priority Recommendations

### High Priority (Core Functionality)
1. **Complete SignalR Implementation**
   - Implement proper connection management
   - Add game state synchronization
   - Handle player actions in real-time

2. **Implement Core Game Logic**
   - Turn management system
   - Card play validation and execution
   - Basic combat resolution

3. **Enhance Client Interactivity**
   - Drag and drop card playing
   - Interactive game board
   - Real-time UI updates

### Medium Priority (User Experience)
1. **Authentication System**
   - User login/registration
   - Session management
   - Security implementation

2. **Matchmaking System**
   - Player matching
   - Game creation and joining
   - Spectator mode

3. **Game Rules Engine**
   - Specific card effect implementations
   - Advanced game mechanics
   - Rule validation

### Low Priority (Polish & Features)
1. **Visual Enhancements**
   - Animations and transitions
   - Improved styling
   - Mobile responsiveness

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Replay system
   - Statistics tracking
   - Tournament mode

## Technical Debt & Code Quality

### Issues Fixed
- ✅ Compilation errors resolved
- ✅ Model property mismatches corrected
- ✅ Service dependency injection fixed

### Remaining Issues
- ⚠️ Many async methods lack await operators (warnings)
- ⚠️ Null reference warnings throughout codebase
- ⚠️ Inconsistent error handling
- ⚠️ Limited unit test coverage (no tests visible)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Focus on SignalR implementation for real-time gameplay
2. **Short-term**: Implement core game logic and turn management
3. **Medium-term**: Enhance UI interactivity and user experience
4. **Long-term**: Add advanced features and polish

The codebase shows a solid foundation with good architectural decisions, but significant work is needed to create a fully functional multiplayer TCG experience.
