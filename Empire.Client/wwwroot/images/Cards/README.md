# Empire TCG Card Images

This directory contains card images for the Empire Trading Card Game.

## Structure
- Images are named using the CardID followed by .jpg extension
- Example: `1001.jpg`, `1002.jpg`, etc.
- Images should be approximately 300x420 pixels (standard trading card aspect ratio)

## Placeholder Images
If actual card images are not available, the system will fall back to:
- `/Cardbacks/armyCardback.png` for army cards
- `/Cardbacks/civicCardback.png` for civic cards

## Adding New Images
1. Name the image file with the exact CardID number
2. Save as .jpg format
3. Place in this directory
4. The system will automatically detect and use the image
