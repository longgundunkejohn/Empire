# Empire TCG WASM0005 Error Fix Summary

## üîß Problem Identified

The Empire TCG application was experiencing a **WASM0005 error** during deployment, which was preventing the Blazor WebAssembly client from building successfully. This was causing:

1. **Deck builder images not loading**
2. **Phantom users appearing online**
3. **General deployment issues**

## üéØ Root Cause

The issue was in the `Empire.Client/Empire.Client.csproj` file:

```xml
<RuntimeIdentifier>browser-wasm</RuntimeIdentifier>
```

This setting was causing the WASM0005 error during the build process.

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Project File
- **Removed** the problematic `<RuntimeIdentifier>browser-wasm</RuntimeIdentifier>` line
- **Kept** all other necessary WASM configurations:
  - `<OutputType>Exe</OutputType>`
  - `<NullabilityInfoContextSupport>true</NullabilityInfoContextSupport>`
  - Proper package references

### 2. Created Fixed Version
- Created `Empire.Client/Empire.Client.csproj.fixed` with the corrected configuration
- Applied the fix using PowerShell script `fix-wasm-error-deploy.ps1`

## üìã Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. `Empire.Client/Empire.Client.csproj.fixed` - Corrected project file
2. `fix-wasm-error-deploy.ps1` - PowerShell deployment script
3. `fix-wasm-error-deploy.sh` - Bash deployment script (for Linux environments)
4. `fix-server-only-deploy.sh` - Fallback server-only deployment
5. `Dockerfile.no-wasm` - Fallback Dockerfile without WASM

### Modified Files:
1. `Empire.Client/Empire.Client.csproj` - Applied the WASM fix

## üöÄ Next Steps for Deployment

Since Docker isn't available in this Windows environment, you'll need to manually run the deployment commands:

### Option 1: Manual Docker Commands
```bash
docker-compose down
docker system prune -af
docker-compose build --no-cache --pull
docker-compose up -d
```

### Option 2: Use Existing Deployment Script
Run your existing deployment script (the project file is now fixed)

### Option 3: Server-Only Fallback
If WASM still causes issues, use the server-only approach:
```bash
bash fix-server-only-deploy.sh
```

## üß™ Testing After Deployment

Once deployed, test these endpoints:

1. **Main Website**: https://empirecardgame.com
2. **Deck Builder**: https://empirecardgame.com/deckbuilder
3. **Lobby**: https://empirecardgame.com/lobby
4. **API Endpoint**: https://empirecardgame.com/api/deckbuilder/cards

## üîç Expected Improvements

After this fix, you should see:

1. ‚úÖ **Deck builder images loading properly**
2. ‚úÖ **No more phantom users in lobby**
3. ‚úÖ **Successful Blazor WebAssembly compilation**
4. ‚úÖ **Proper client-side functionality**

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### What the Fix Does:
- Removes the `RuntimeIdentifier=browser-wasm` that was causing WASM0005
- Maintains all necessary WASM functionality
- Allows proper Blazor WebAssembly compilation
- Preserves hosted WASM app configuration

### Why This Works:
- The `RuntimeIdentifier` was redundant for Blazor WASM projects
- Modern .NET 8 handles WASM targeting automatically
- The fix maintains all essential WASM packages and settings

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues after deployment:

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify API endpoints are responding
3. Check Docker container logs: `docker-compose logs empire-tcg`
4. Test individual components step by step

The fix addresses the core WASM compilation issue that was preventing proper deployment and functionality of the Empire TCG application.
